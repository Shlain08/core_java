// QUESTION 2
/*
1. CLASS NAME;
   - Ritesh
   - Jaswal
   
2. FUNCTION NAME;
   - ritesh()
   - jaswal()

3. Variable;

//QUESTION 3
/*
1. 
  -.java file;
    -THIS FILE IS WHAT IS NEEDED TO BE COMPILED IN A PROGRAM.
	-THIS IS NOT CASE SENSITIVE IN CMD CODE.
	-javac file_name.java IS USED TO COMPILE A .java file IN CMD.
	
  -.class file;
    -THIS FILE IS THE ONE WHICH GETS EXECUTED/RUN IN A PROGRAM.
    -THIS IS CASE SENSITIVE IN CMD CODE. 	
    -java class_name IS USED TO COMPILE A .class file IN CMD.
    
2. 
  JAVA IS NOT A COMPLETE OOPS PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE AS IT NOT ONLY FOCUSES ON OBJECTS IN A PROGRAM  
  BUT ALSO ON THE PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES LIKE INT,CHAR,BYTE,ETC. TO USE A PURE OOPS CONCEPT IN JAVA
  WRAPPER CLASSES ARE USED OR NEEDED.
  
3.
  EXAMPLE OF NR-WA:-
  void ritzz(int a,int b)
  {
   int c = a+b;
   System.out.println("VALUE OF C IS- "+c+".");
  }

*/

//QUESTION 5
/*
WRAPPER CLASSES ARE A TYPE OF CLASSES NEEDED TO USE THE CONCEPT OF PURE OOPS IN JAVA AS WE KNOW THAT 
JAVA IS NOT A COMPLETE OR PURE OOPS LANGUAGE.WRAPPER CLASSES ARE USED INSTEAD OF PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES
LIKE int,double. THE WRAPPER CLASS OF "int" WILL BE "INTEGER" AND FOR "double" IT WILL BE "Double".
EX:-
    INTEGER a = 10;
